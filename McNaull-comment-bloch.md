Marc Bloch eloquently states the challenges of all who choose to wear the mantel of Historian. Writing in the Historian's Craft 
Bloch reflects on how an historian knows what it is he knows and then presents the quintessential question of now that we know
it, so what? If history is too be meaningful it is necessary for the crafter to bring all of their intellectual skills to the 
task at hand. 

Bloch points to the errors which the practioner can make and they present a good basis for the discussion of his work. The first
pitfall is to make an idol of origins. Historians and philosophers have seemingly been obsessed with origins; origins of 
species, origins of traditions, origins of laws, origins of political systems,. . . etc.. John Stuart Mill writing in 
Utilitarianism, begins his quest for an ideal society by looking back at the life of primitive people in an altruistic, almost longing fashion. But how can we know, as an historian must know, what came before civilization if we are to make conclusions about that time. The desire to draw conclusions based on less than adequate evidence is a trap that Bloch warns us to avoid.
Bloch refers to this as a mania for making judgments and should very justly be avoided. If we wish to make judgments we do so at the peril of our own intellectual integrity.

Bloch next proceeds to seemingly reverse course by introducing the search for human nature, those constants which define all of humanity. Bloch is looking for his own origins and even if they are maleable as he states then they become his version of an idol. This is the rubric by which all events are to be judged but it in fact leaves us with just a shell since different people have different natures. Some people are predisposed to have more of an apetite for food than someone else. Whereas another person will inordinately care more for the acquistion of money than any other endeavor. Is it really necessary to answer the nature or nurture conumdrum before history can be written? Are we then to abandon these questions which might yield a great deal to another historian of greater understanding.
